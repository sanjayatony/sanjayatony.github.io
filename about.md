Hi, my name is Tony Sanjaya, a web developer, a super heroes enthusiast, father of Nauly Sanjaya, husband of Nevya Rizawa.

## What do you do for living?
I make website and stuff. Currently I remote work as Web Analyst and Developer for [Stampede Design](http://stampede-design.com){:target="_blank"}, a Malaysian company.

## Explain more..
I work as a web developer since 2010. My journey begin with plain PHP coding. And after that continue with WordPress until now. In the middle of it I also learned a bit about CodeIgniter. Currently, my responsibility is integrating HTML into CMS such as WordPress, Joomla, Shopify, BigCommerce. I also have interest in Laravel and Javascript language (Angular and Vue). But still in <a class="fancybox" href="{{ "upload/kuuga-growing-form.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" title="Kuuga Growing Form">Kuuga growing form</a>.

## What about your weapons?
After quiet sometime use [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/){:target="_blank"}, I have nothing against Elementary OS btw, it's just sometime the bug is bugging me. If I have much time, that shouldn't be a problem. I need a weapon that understand me, and just work. Like <a class="fancybox" href="{{ "upload/krblack-hopper.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" title="Kamen Rider Black with Battle Hopper">Kamen Rider Black with his Battle Hopper!</a> Then after thinking quite sometime (read:saving) I choose MacBook Pro with retina display. For now this is a perfect weapon for me. And also I have [DELL P2314H](http://www.dell.com/ed/business/p/dell-p2314h/pd){:target="_blank"} for my external monitor, [Sennheiser HD220](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-202-Professional-Headphones-Black/dp/B003LPTAYI){:target="_blank"} for the headphone, ~~mouse Logitech M235~~ currently more comfortable using trackpad.

[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/){:target="_blank"} is my main editor, ~~although sometime I use Bracket, or visual studio code, but yeah sublime is my home I think. I always back to use it~~ never use them for a long time. For task management I use [Trello](https://trello.com/){:target="_blank"} and ~~[Moodo](https://www.moo.do/){:target="_blank"}~~ [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/){:target:"_blank"}. In office we use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/){:target="_blank"} for project management, [Toggl](https://toggl.com){:target="_blank"} for timer, and of course [Slack](https://slack.com/){:target="_blank"} for communicate. I also use [Mou](http://25.io/mou/){:target="_blank"} for writing (I use it to write this post).

## What should I do if I want to contact you?
