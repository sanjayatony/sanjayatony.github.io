Hi, my name is Tony Sanjaya, a web developer, a super heroes enthusiast, father of Nauly Sanjaya, husband of Nevya Rizawa.

# What do you do?
I make website and stuff. Currently I remote work as Web Analyst and Developer for Stampede Design, a Malaysian company.

# Explain more about your weapons..
After quiet sometime use Elementary OS, I have nothing against Elementary OS, it just sometime the bug is bugging me. If I have much time, that shouldn't be a problem. I need a weapon that understand me, and just work. I choose MacBook Pro with retina display. This is my dream machine and a perfect weapon for me. And also DELL P2314H for my external monitor. Sennheiser HD220 for the headphone.

Sublime is my main editor, although sometime I use bracket, atom, or visual studio code, but yeah sublime is my home I think. I always back to use it. For task management I use Trello and Moodo.

# What shoul I do if I want to contact you?
Please light up the bat signal.
