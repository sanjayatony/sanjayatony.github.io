In New52, Aquaman is already a badass character. Although the costum not so much different from the past but I like it. From the eyes, we know he is a badass, thanks to Ivan Reis. Here the image, Aquaman full of emotion, as a reader I feel emotional too.

Now, in incoming Batman v Superman movie, Zack Snyder release a picture of Jason Momoa as Aquaman. Dude it is super badass!
