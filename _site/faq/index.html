        <p><strong>Who the fuck are you?</strong><br />
Hello..My name is Tony S, I am a web developer (read : a keyboard tapper).</p>

<p><strong>Are you famous or something?</strong><br />
Ha ha ha ha of course not, I am just ordinary man, not so popular in society. But I am married a great woman, thats make me not ordinary anymore. Yes, I am great!</p>

<p><strong>So what did you do?</strong><br />
8 to 5 I am just a web developer, most like a front end developer but sometime do some back end stuff. By the night I am a superhero who protect JTown from bad things. Yeah superhero stuff. Ssst its a secret, please dont tell anybody.</p>

<p><strong>That adsurb, what is your tools to do your web developing stuff?</strong><br />
My tools?<br />
Ok, Ill split it into 3 section<br />
<strong>Hardware</strong>, in office I use HP pavillion (I forgot the code) with a cheap laptop stand and Logitech MK220 keyboard mouse wireless, Sennheiser HD 220. In home I use Toshiba Satellite Pro XXX with Logitech M235 mouse. Both of the laptop have 8Gb of RAM. Yeah that is not so great machine. But that is more than enough to edit file , open browser, open photoshop. But I have a dream what will be my dream machine. Maybe someday.</p>

<p><strong>Software</strong>, I many editors, based on function and my feeling, Brackets, Sublime, Atom. Chrome for the browser, it has a ton of useful extensions and it is integrated with Google. Todoist for my task management.</p>

<p><strong>OS</strong>, ussually use Windows, but lately been hanging up with Elementary OS.</p>

<p><strong>Please tell me about your superhero stuff..</strong>
I love all superheroes related. If you ask me to choose one, I cant. Because I have to fair and square to all of them :D</p>

<p><strong>Errrr, so you are not a superhero?</strong><br />
Are you retarded?Of course not.</p>

<p><strong>If I want to contact you, what shoul I do?</strong><br />
Please light up the <a href="/bat-signal">bat signal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Hmmm</strong></p>
