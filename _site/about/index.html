<h1 id="explain-more-about-your-weapons">Explain more about your weapons..</h1>
<p>After quiet sometime use Elementary OS, I have nothing against Elementary OS, it just sometime the bug is bugging me. If I have much time, that shouldnâ€™t be a problem. I need a weapon that understand me, and just work. I choose MacBook Pro with retina display. This is my dream machine and a perfect weapon for me. And also DELL P2314H for my external monitor. Sennheiser HD220 for the headphone.</p>

<p>Sublime is my main editor, although sometime I use bracket, atom, or visual studio code, but yeah sublime is my home I think. I always back to use it. For task management I use Trello and Moodo.</p>
